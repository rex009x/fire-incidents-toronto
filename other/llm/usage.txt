Hello, i'm currently writing my data analysis on Toronto's Open Data dataset "Fire Incidents" which encapsulates fire incidents that occur in the Toronto area. Here is my abstract to give you better guidance and context as to what I am trying to accomplish:

"This paper uses publicly available data from [Toronto Open Data](https://open.toronto.ca/) to predict the estimated dollar loss per fire incident in the Toronto area by property use. Further analysis of Toronto Fire Services' response time, area of origin, and various fire prevention measures as considering factors in the estimation. The results reveal a positive correlation between estimated dollar loss and possible causes of the incident, namely, mechanical/electrical failures yielding the highest loss. These findings bring urgency to fire safety as they highlight the importance of proper education, maintenance, and safety inspections. This analysis encourages homeowners, businesses, and property managers to take initiative in order to ensure the well-being of others."

More information that I would like you provide:
There are additional factors to consider concerning fire incidents such as the presence of fire alarms in the vicinity, whether or not there was a fire alarm failure, the type of fire alarm (independently hardwired, battery operated, interconnected, etc), and the number of responding personal from the Toronto Fire Services (TFS). All of these factors may attribute to the estimated dollar loss caused by the fire incident.

With the information I have provided, write as a novice data analyst, an introduction to my data analysis. This analysis is aimed towards other novice/advanced data analysts or university students. Use language that is not too complicated to understand.

Below are the requirements/rubric for the introduction. Ensuring each is captured will result in the most successful introduction section.

"The introduction is self-contained and tells a reader everything they need to know including: 1) broader context to motivate; 2) some detail about what the paper is about; 3) a clear gap that needs to be filled; 4) what was done; 5) what was found; 6) why it is important; 7) the structure of the paper. A reader should be able to read only the introduction and know what was done, why, and what was found. Likely 3 or 4 paragraphs, or 10 per cent of total."

**Introduction:**

Fires pose a significant threat to both residential and commercial properties, often resulting in substantial financial losses and, more importantly, endangering lives. Understanding the factors influencing the estimated dollar loss per fire incident is crucial for implementing effective fire prevention measures and minimizing the impact of such incidents. In this analysis, we delve into the rich dataset provided by Toronto Open Data, specifically focusing on fire incidents within the Toronto area. By leveraging this dataset, we aim to predict the estimated dollar loss per fire incident across different property uses and uncover the factors contributing to these losses.

**Motivation and Objectives:**

The motivation behind this study stems from the necessity to comprehend the underlying patterns and determinants of fire incident costs. By dissecting the data provided by Toronto Open Data, we seek to not only predict the estimated dollar loss but also to identify significant factors influencing these losses. Our analysis extends beyond mere prediction, delving into factors such as Toronto Fire Services' response time, area of origin, and the presence and functionality of fire alarms. These additional variables are essential in understanding the dynamics of fire incidents and formulating informed strategies for fire prevention and mitigation.

**Research Gap and Methodology:**

Despite the abundance of data available, there remains a gap in comprehensively analyzing the factors contributing to the estimated dollar loss per fire incident in the Toronto area. To address this gap, we employ a data-driven approach, utilizing statistical modeling techniques to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset. Our methodology involves exploring various factors such as property use, possible causes of the incident (e.g., mechanical/electrical failures), and the presence and functionality of fire alarms. Additionally, we incorporate the number of responding personnel from the Toronto Fire Services (TFS) as a variable to assess its impact on the estimated dollar loss.

**Significance and Structure:**

The findings of this analysis hold significant implications for fire safety practices and policies in the Toronto area. By understanding the factors influencing the estimated dollar loss per fire incident, stakeholders can prioritize resources and implement targeted interventions to mitigate fire risks effectively. This paper is structured as follows: we first provide an overview of the dataset and variables considered, followed by the methodology employed for analysis. Subsequently, we present our findings, discussing the relationships uncovered and their implications for fire safety. Finally, we conclude by highlighting the importance of our findings and suggesting avenues for future research in this domain.

Can you propose a solution to resolve this? Perhaps grouping/categorizing the areas under some terms that capture the areas?

ChatGPT

When dealing with a large number of categories, it's often helpful to group or categorize them into broader categories to make the visualization more manageable and interpretable. Here's one approach to group the area_of_origin into broader categories:

R

# Define a function to group areas into broader categories
group_areas <- function(area) {
  if (grepl("Living|Sleeping|Dining|Cooking|Washroom|Sauna|Laundry|Closet", area)) {
    return("Living and Common Areas")
  } else if (grepl("Storage|Locker|Garage|Trash|Basement|Elevator|Chimney|Mechanical|Ducting|Utility|Awning|Porch|Crawl Space|Concealed|Attic|Open Area|Court|Parking|Fuel|Deck", area)) {
    return("Storage and Structural")
  } else if (grepl("Engine|Running Gear|Electrical|Fuel|Operator|Passenger|Trunk|Cargo|Vehicle", area)) {
    return("Vehicle Components")
  } else if (grepl("Manufacturing|Assembly|Laboratory|Operating Room|Performance|Backstage", area)) {
    return("Functional and Performance Areas")
  } else if (grepl("Office|Sales, Showroom|Records", area)) {
    return("Office and Sales")
  } else if (grepl("Entranceway|Hallway|Stairway|Court, Atrium|Other Means of Egress", area)) {
    return("Entrance and Exit")
  } else if (grepl("Exterior Wall|Roof|Concealed|Wall|Structural|Attic|Open Area|Court|Patio|Terrace", area)) {
    return("Outside Areas")
  } else if (grepl("Multiple|Residential/Business|Other - unclassified|Undetermined|Under Investigation", area)) {
    return("Other/Undetermined")
  } else {
    return("Other")
  }
}

Adjust the grouping function as needed to capture the most relevant categories for your analysis.

the values of the types of smoke alarms are very long and I wish to shorten them. Here are all the unique values:

"8 - Not applicable - no smoke alarm or presence undetermined", [3] "2 - Hardwired (standalone)","1 - Battery operated", [5] "4 - Interconnected", "3 - Wireless"                                       

can you write some R code that will clean these value names?

ChatGPT

Certainly! You can create a function to clean and shorten the names of the smoke alarm configurations. Here's how you can do it:

```R
# Define a function to clean and shorten the smoke alarm configuration names
clean_smoke_alarm_names <- function(name) {
  # Create a named vector to map original names to cleaned names
  name_map <- c(
    "8 - Not applicable - no smoke alarm or presence undetermined" = "No Alarm/Undetermined",
    "2 - Hardwired (standalone)" = "Hardwired",
    "1 - Battery operated" = "Battery Operated",
    "4 - Interconnected" = "Interconnected",
    "3 - Wireless" = "Wireless"
  )
  # Use the name map to clean the names
  cleaned_name <- name_map[name]
  # If the name is not found in the map, return the original name
  if (is.na(cleaned_name)) {
    return(name)
  } else {
    return(cleaned_name)
  }
}

# Test the function with an example
clean_smoke_alarm_names("8 - Not applicable - no smoke alarm or presence undetermined")
```

This code defines a function called `clean_smoke_alarm_names` that takes a smoke alarm configuration name as input and returns a cleaned and shortened version of the name. Adjust the `name_map` vector as needed to map each original name to its corresponding cleaned name. You can then apply this function to the smoke alarm configuration names in your dataset.

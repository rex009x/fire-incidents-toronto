# Evaluating Toronto's Fire Incidents Data

## Overview

This repo provides students with a foundation for their own projects associated with *Telling Stories with Data*. You do not need every aspect for every paper and you should delete aspects that you do not need.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from [OpenDataToronto's Fire Incidents data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/fire-incidents/).
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of ChatGPT. The abstract, introduction, and discussion sections were written using ChatGPT. The entire chat history is available in `other/llm/usage.txt`.
